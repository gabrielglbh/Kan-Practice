## Making your own KanPractice

If you want to replicate this app on your device with a custom back-end, fork the repo and include your own Google Services files for iOS or Android. Make sure your back-end matches the models described in code, although you can also change them to match yours!

If you wish to distribute a new app based on this one, remember to change the Bundle ID on iOS and Package on Android and make sure to acknowledge this work on your newly created app!
- *For iOS*: make sure you create your own Provisioning Profile and Certificate for Apple devices and export them to XCode. 
- *For Android*: create the `jks` file for signing using `keytool`, and create the `key.properties` file under `android/` as in the [official documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android#create-an-upload-keystore).

## Code Structure for Contributing

Code is based on 2 main folders: `ui` and `core`, with self explanatory meanings. On `main.dart` you will find the main `Widget` that runs the app with all of its configuration.

### Language Addition

The language management system is handled by JSON files located under `lib/core/localization/`. Current languages are Spanish and English.
Contribution needed for more languages to be added.

If you wish to contribute by adding a new language, you must perform these actions:

- Copy and paste an already added language JSON file and create the new language file with the name: `<language_code>.json`.
- Then, add the language into the supported locales in `lib/main.dart` under the `EasyLocalization` widget.
- You are good. In case you want to build the app for iOS, you must include the localization in the `info.plist` under the key `CFBundleLocalizations`.

### `Core`

Subdivided in:

- `database`: related code for database management (creation of db, queries, db models and helper constants).
- `firebase`: related code for firebase and backup management (services of back up and authentication, queries and firebase models).
- `preferences`: related code for the Shared Preferences helper to store key-value data in the device.
- `routing`: related code for managing the routing of the pages of the app.
- `utils`: code that is purely functional and that is used across the app.

Please, refer to the comments to better understand the code.

### `UI`

Subdivided in:

- `pages`: the different pages are subdivided in their respective folder, each one having their own bloc management (when needed).
- `theme`: purely UI code as colors, theming, heights...
- `widgets`: UI components with functional elements that are reused across the app.
